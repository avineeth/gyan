The core collection interface:

## Traversing Collections
There are three ways to traverse collections:
- using aggregate operations ( TODO: JDK 1.8 lambda expressions)
- with the for-each construct 
`for(String t : names)
 System.out.println("ForEach = [" + t + "]");`

- by using Iterators. 
   Note that Iterator. remove is the only safe way to modify a collection during iteration; the behavior is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified in any other way while the iteration is in progress.

`Iterator<String> it = names.iterator();
while(it.hasNext()) {
   System.out.println("Iterator = [" + it.next() + "]");
   it.remove();
}
System.out.println("has elements = [" + it.hasNext() + "]");
`



# Sorting

### Merge Sort

#### Definition:
- A comparison based sorting algorithm
- Divides entire dataset into groups of at most two.
- Compares each number one at a time, moving the smallest number to left of the pair.
- Once all pairs sorted it then compares left most elements of the two leftmost pairs creating a sorted group of four with the smallest numbers on the left and the largest ones on the right.
- This process is repeated until there is only one set.

#### What you need to know:

- This is one of the most basic sorting algorithms.
- Know that it divides all the data into as small possible sets then compares them.

#### Big O efficiency:

- Best Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(½ n lg n)
- Average Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n log n)
- Worst Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n log n)

#### Java's Arrays.sort method uses Quicksort for arrays of primitives and merge sort for arrays of objects. 
The most likely reason: quicksort is not stable, i.e. equal entries can change their relative position during the sort; among other things, this means that if you sort an already sorted array, it may not stay unchanged.
Since primitive types have no identity (there is no way to distinguish two ints with the same value), this does not matter for them. But for reference types, it could cause problems for some applications. Therefore, a stable merge sort is used for those.


### Difference between Comparable and Comparator Interface. 
- a.compareTo(b): Comparable interface :
  - Compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than, equal, or greater than.
  - If your class objects have a natural order, implement the Comparable<T> interface and define this method. All Java classes that have a natural ordering implement Comparable<T> - Example: String, wrapper classes, BigInteger
- compare(a, b):
  - Comparator interface : Compares values of two objects. This is implemented as part of the Comparator<T> interface, and the typical use is to define one or more small utility classes that implement this, to pass to methods such as sort() or for use by sorting data structures such as TreeMap and TreeSet. You might want to create a Comparator object for the following:
  - Multiple comparisons. To provide several different ways to sort something. For example, you might want to sort a Person class by name, ID, age, height, ... You would define a Comparator for each of these to pass to the sort() method.
  - System class To provide comparison methods for classes that you have no control over. For example, you could define a Comparator for Strings that compared them by length.
  - Strategy pattern To implement a Strategy pattern, which is a situation where you want to represent an algorithm as an object that you can pass as a parameter, save in a data structure, etc.

Binary search tree: Used for searching. A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and where the right child only contains nodes with values greater than or equal to the parent.

### Symbol Tables
- Key-value pair abstraction.
  - Insert a value with specified key.
  - Given a key, search for the corresponding value.
- Ex. DNS lookup.
  - Insert domain name with specified IP address.
  - Given domain name, find corresponding IP address.
* key domain name          IP address

### Divide and Conquer
- Like Greedy and Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps.

1. Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
2. Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems
3. Combine: Appropriately combine the answers

- Following are some standard algorithms that are Divide and Conquer algorithms.

1) Binary Search is a searching algorithm. In each step, the algorithm compares the input element x with the value of the middle element in array. If the values match, return the index of middle. Otherwise, if x is less than the middle element, then the algorithm recurs for left side of middle element, else recurs for right side of middle element.

2) Quicksort is a sorting algorithm. The algorithm picks a pivot element, rearranges the array elements in such a way that all elements smaller than the picked pivot element move to left side of pivot, and all greater elements move to right side. Finally, the algorithm recursively sorts the subarrays on left and right of pivot element.

3) Merge Sort is also a sorting algorithm. The algorithm divides the array in two halves, recursively sorts them and finally merges the two sorted halves.

4) Closest Pair of Points The problem is to find the closest pair of points in a set of points in x-y plane. The problem can be solved in O(n^2) time by calculating distances of every pair of points and comparing the distances to find the minimum. The Divide and Conquer algorithm solves the problem in O(nLogn) time.
